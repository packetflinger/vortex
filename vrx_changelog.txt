** Changed upgrade system back to the way it used to be. All abilities can be upgraded to level 10 by any class, but if you upgrade something out of your class-specific abilities, you will receive a 50% penalty. This will prevent the creation of uber-defense characters that have been plaguing Vortex lately, and will force more class specialization.

v2.14
==================

** Fixed bug with createquad/invuln that would give players 10 seconds of quad/invuln for each monster kill in pvp

==================

** Increased cost of jetpack
** BFG now only inflicts 50% damage to it's owner when they fire too close (since the BFG is like an energy rocket)
** Re-wrote knock weapon code to work more efficiently, with slightly reduced effectiveness. You have to fire at a player's weapon to have it knock (the general area anyway), they must have less than 50% health, there is only a 50% chance of it actually knocking, and it only tries once every 2 seconds (so using an MG with knock weapon is no more effective than using a RG)

v2.15
==================

** Fixed a bug that allowed fast weapon switching to bypass secondary mode switchover delay
** Halved power cube cost of parasite transformation ability

** Increased effectiveness of createinvin (you get 2 seconds per frag after it activates)
** Newbie bashers don't spree off players half their level and below
** Increased sword length from 56 units at level 10 to 64 units and doubled burn damage

==================
v4.4x
==================
** Lasertrap will trace to wall when building to avoid clipping walls
** Mutant and brain can now boost while in water
** Increased sentry addon bullet damage to 2 (from 1) to better compete with uber-monsters (e.g. tank has damage output between 400-500/s with same aim and far more hp/armor)
** Increased minisentry addon rocket damage to 15 (from 10), see reason above
** Reinstituted vampire health/armor cap of 50/25 per second (it wasn't supposed to be removed), regardless of base/max health (was 15% of base/max health per second)

** Reduced fire totem health bonus to 2x (from 3x) due to increased base totem health
** Reduced base frame multiplier for super healer talent to 3.0 (from 4.5), reduced addon multiplier to 0.4 (from 0.5); net benefit is that talent will heal armor to full in the same time that it takes to heal health (e.g. 5 seconds at skill level 10) at max talent
** Removed cocoon armor regeneration, set cocooned duration to 5 seconds (at any level), cocooned entity can no longer be hurt
** Cocoon now gives health only when bonus is awarded, 25% + 7.5% per level (100% max)

** Spikers and gasser can't be built in or near the enemy base
** Fixed lance impact effect so it appears at the impact point (rather than the center of the lance)

** Reduce maximum accuracy of most monsters by 10% or more, tank rocket accuracy reduced to 50% (from 90%)
